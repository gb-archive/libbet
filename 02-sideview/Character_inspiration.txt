Libbet's name is intended to be Yet Another Form of [Elisheva]â„¢.
Age-wise, she's an adolescent: old enough to get a below-ground room
to herself but not quite fully grown.

Her kind isn't quite the same as the polis that appear in
_RHDE: Furniture Fight_ and my 240p Test Suite ports.  In particular,
a boulder person's pelvis extends a bit more forward and up to allow
curling up into a ball, locking the head into the chest, and rolling.
The chest tends to be somewhat flat with the breasts farther apart
to allow space for the head.

I must have had something like armadillos, pangolins, [de Blob],
[Guardbot], [nevalyashka dolls], and/or [Terra-Firmians] on my mind
when coming up with the design for a boulder person.  Libbet is
female in part because of a [forum post by DRW] lamenting the lack of
original solo woman characters in games for 8-bit Nintendo systems.
