Libbet the boulder girl
=======================
"One day, Libbet was rearranging her basement when she discovered
a passage to an empty hall whose floor had a peculiar pattern.
She rolled in to investigate."

This repository contains research toward developing a video game,
including sketches of its main character Libbet.  I expect to release
the game as free software once it is playable.  But disclosing
its title too early would lead to unrealistic expectations of the
project's completion schedule among those who follow my work.

At first, I tried to use the confused perspective common among 8-bit
overhead games, where the background is semi-overhead but the moving
characters are drawn as if viewed from the side.  It looked fine for
rolling and for hopping sideways, but not for hopping up or down.
