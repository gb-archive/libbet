How to make AVIs in bgb:

In Options, open "Sound" and enable "WAV file writer" and "record
AVI", output, then Apply.  Play the demo, then disable them and hit
Apply when the demo ends.

How to encode:

    ffmpeg -y -i bgb-1567896789.avi -i bgb-1567896789.wav -r 30 \
      -vf 'scale=320:288:sws_flags=neighbor' \
      -pix_fmt yuv420p -ab 64000 -movflags +faststart out.mp4

What does this mean?

* `-y`: Overwrite previous encode if any
* `-i`: Video and audio track inputs
* `-r`: Reduce frame rate, as DMG games don't need to run faster than
  30 fps, and YouTube doesn't support high motion LDTV, SDTV, or EDTV
* `-vf`: Apply video filters, where `scale=` sets the video size and
  `sws_flags=neighbor` specifies blocky resampling
* `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Encode color (U and V chroma planes) smaller
  than full resolution.  Many web-based players require this.
  The pixel doubling to 288p ensures that this step loses no quality.
* `-ab`: Set AAC audio bitrate
* `-movflags +faststart`: Add an index to allow playback before the
  entire video downloads

To change the pixel aspect ratio to the 8:7 of an NTSC Super Game
Boy, run two `scale` filters in a row.

    ffmpeg -y -i bgb-1567896789.avi -i bgb-1567896789.wav -r 30 \
      -vf 'scale=320:288:sws_flags=neighbor, scale=364:288:sws_flags=bilinear' \
      -pix_fmt yuv420p -ab 64000 -movflags +faststart out.mp4

If your recording has an SGB border, the sizes may need to be changed
to `512:448` and `584:448`.
