How to make AVIs in bgb:

In Options, open "audio" and enable wave and AVI output, then Apply.
Play the demo, then disable them and hit Apply when the demo ends.

How to encode:

    ffmpeg -y -i bgb-1567896789.avi -i bgb-1567896789.wav -r 30 \
      -s 320x288 -sws_flags neighbor -pix_fmt yuv420p -ab 64000 \
      -movflags +faststart out.mp4

What does this mean?

* `-y`: Overwrite previous encode if any
* `-i`: Video and audio track inputs
* `-r`: Reduce frame rate, as DMG games don't need to run faster than
  30 fps, and YouTube doesn't support high motion LDTV, SDTV, or EDTV
* `-s`: Scale video, where `-sws_flags neighbor` specifies blocky
  resampling
* `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Encode color (U and V chroma planes) smaller
  than full resolution.  Many web-based players require this.
  The pixel doubling to 288p ensures that this step loses no quality.
* `-ab`: Set AAC audio bitrate
* `-movflags +faststart`: Add an index to allow playback before the
  entire video downloads
